      <h3>Smart Home</h3>
      <p>As a developer of DIY smart home hub software, I want to safely expose a standardized web-based API for
        monitoring and controlling a range of smart home devices using different underlying protocols, so that cloud
        services from multiple vendors can add value to a user's smart home without having to implement a
        vendor-specific API.</p>
      <p>As a developer of a smart home mobile app, I want to offer my users out-of-the-box interoperability with a
        wide range of smart home devices so that I can maximise the audience for my app.</p>
      <p>As a developer of a smart home device, I want my device to be controllable by any smart home hub software
        and/or any smart home mobile app that conforms to a common standard.</p>
