    This document outlines use cases and requirements for the proposed WoT Profiles 2.0 specification,
    which is intended to eventually replace WoT Profiles 1.0 [[wot-profile]].

  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things (WoT)</a> seeks to counter the fragmentation of the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> by using and extending
      existing, standardized web technologies.
    </p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">W3C Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description 1.1
        specification</a> [[wot-thing-description11]] defines an information model and JSON-based representation format
      for describing the capabilities of connected devices and the interfaces with which to communicate with them.
      Thing Descriptions are designed to be protocol-agnostic and flexible enough to describe a wide range of existing
      IoT devices.</p>
    <p>In order to provide this level of flexibility the Thing Description specification includes a number of extension
      points including protocol bindings, payload bindings, security mechanisms, link relations, and semantic contexts.
      As long as all of the capabilities of a device can be described using a Thing Description and a
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#dfn-consumer">Consumer</a> [[wot-architecture11]] implements
      all of the extensions used, the Consumer should be able to interoperate with that device. However, the result of
      this extensible architecture is that any given Consumer can only interoperate with a subset of possible
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#dfn-web-thing">Web Things</a>.
    </p>
    <p>"WoT Profiles" are a mechanism by which out-of-the-box interoperability between WoT Consumers and Things can be
      guaranteed, by constraining a Thing to a finite list of options for each extension point, and requiring that it
      conforms to certain defaults. As long as a Consumer implements all of the extensions and defaults prescribed by a
      Profile, it should be guaranteed to be able to use all of the capabilities of a Thing which conform to that
      Profile, without Thing-specific customisation.</p>
    <p>Whilst the Web of Things provides the freedom to describe a wide range of existing IoT systems using Thing
      Descriptions, Profiles provide an optional additional layer of common constraints to which new implementations can
      conform in order to benefit from an increased level of interoperability.</p>
    <p>Profiles are designed to constrain, not extend, the Web of Things. They should only be used to constrain the set
      of options for existing extension points, never to extend the Web of Things directly.</p>
    <p>Conforming to a Profile does not prevent a Web Thing from describing additional capabilities or protocol bindings
      beyond those described in the Profile in their Thing Description, as long as they conform with all of the
      normative assertions of the Profile. </p>
    <p>Profiles are designed to promote cross-vendor and cross-domain interoperability, so a Profile should not be
      restricted to a single application domain.</p>

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <section id="smart-home-use-cases">
      <h3>Smart Home</h3>
      <p>As a developer of DIY smart home hub software, I want to safely expose a standardized web-based API for
        monitoring and controlling a range of smart home devices using different underlying protocols, so that cloud
        services from multiple vendors can add value to a user's smart home without having to implement a
        vendor-specific API.</p>
      <p>As a developer of a smart home mobile app, I want to offer my users out-of-the-box interoperability with a
        wide range of smart home devices so that I can maximise the audience for my app.</p>
      <p>As a developer of a smart home device, I want my device to be controllable by any smart home hub software
        and/or any smart home mobile app that conforms to a common standard.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="smart-building-use-cases">
      <h3>Smart Buildings</h3>
      <p>As a developer of a smart building hub, I want to consolidate multiple building management systems from
        different vendors into a standardized web-based API, which cloud services can consume to safely monitor
        and control commercial buildings over the web without needing to implement vendor-specific APIs.
      </p>
      <p>As a developer of a smart building cloud service, I want to be able to provide data analytics for smart
        buildings using smart building hubs from different vendors whose APIs conform to a common standard, rather than
        having to implement multiple vendor-specific APIs.

  <section id="requirements">
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <section id="profiling-mechanism-requirements">
      <h3>Profiling Mechanism</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The specification shall define a mechanism by which the author of a WoT Thing Description can denote that
          the Thing it describes conforms to a particular profile.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section id="profile-registry-requirements">
      <h3>Profile Registry</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The specification shall define a <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#reg-def">registry</a>
          [[w3c-process]] of Profiles to which WoT Things and WoT Consumers may conform, including:
          <ol>
            <li>A registry definition which defines the fields of the registry table, the policy for modifying entries,
              the custodian of the registry, and what an individual Profile specification may contain</li>
            <li>A registry table which enumerates the registered Profiles, including stable URIs to identify them</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The registry definition shall guide the custodian to aim to keep the number of registered profiles as small
          as possible, by rejecting registrations for profiles that significantly overlap in technologies or use cases,
          in order to minimise fragmentation on the Web of Things</li>
      </ol>
