    This document outlines use cases and requirements for the proposed WoT Profiles 2.0 specification,
    which is intended to eventually replace WoT Profiles 1.0 [[wot-profile]].

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <section id="smart-home-use-cases">
      <h3>Smart Home</h3>
      <p>As a developer of DIY smart home hub software, I want to safely expose a standardized web-based API for
        monitoring and controlling a range of smart home devices using different underlying protocols, so that cloud
        services from multiple vendors can add value to a user's smart home without having to implement a
        vendor-specific API.</p>
      <p>As a developer of a smart home mobile app, I want to offer my users out-of-the-box interoperability with a
        wide range of smart home devices so that I can maximise the audience for my app.</p>
      <p>As a developer of a smart home device, I want my device to be controllable by any smart home hub software
        and/or any smart home mobile app that conforms to a common standard.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="smart-building-use-cases">
      <h3>Smart Buildings</h3>
      <p>As a developer of a smart building hub, I want to consolidate multiple building management systems from
        different vendors into a standardized web-based API, which cloud services can consume to safely monitor
        and control commercial buildings over the web without needing to implement vendor-specific APIs.
      </p>
      <p>As a developer of a smart building cloud service, I want to be able to provide data analytics for smart
        buildings using smart building hubs from different vendors whose APIs conform to a common standard, rather than
        having to implement multiple vendor-specific APIs.

      <h3>Profiling Mechanism</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The specification shall define a mechanism by which the author of a WoT Thing Description can denote that
          the Thing it describes conforms to a particular profile.</li>
