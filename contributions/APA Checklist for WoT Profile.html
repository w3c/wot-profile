	<h1>[DRAFT] <abbr title="Framework for Accessibility in the Specification of Technologies">FAST</abbr> Checklist
	</h1>
	<p>This is a draft checklist to support <a href="/">Framework for Accessibility in the Specification of Technologies
			(FAST)</a> prepared by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working
			Group</a>. The goal of <abbr
			title="Framework for Accessibility in the Specification of Technologies">FAST</abbr> is to describe the
		features that web technologies should provide to ensure it is possible to create content that is accessible to
		users with disabilities. The full framework references an analysis of user requirements, describes how
		technologies, content authoring, and user agents work together to meet these needs, and provides comprehensive
		guidance to technology developers. This checklist extracts that information at a high level to aid in
		self-review of technologies. Specification developers can use this to help ensure the technology will address
		features likely to be raised during horizontal review from accessibility proponents.</p>
	<p>Web technologies address a variety of needs, and play a variety of roles in web accessibility. Content languages
		describe primary content, styling languages impact presentation, APIs enable manipulation and data interchange,
		and protocols tie it all together. Each of these types of technologies can impact accessibility. </p>
	<p>This checklist is organized by types of features that a technology may provide. If the technology provides such a
		feature, the checklist items under the heading are applicable and should be examined. If the technology does not
		provide such a feature, the checklist items under the heading are not applicable and can be passed over.</p>

				<td>There is a defined way for a non-visual rendering to be created. </td>
				<td>Content is frequently authored with visual rendering the primary consideration. Some technologies,
					such as image formats, explicitly focus on visual rendering. Some users are not able to access
					visual content, and must use other forms of the content, such as text or audio. Content that is
					well-structured allows automated conversion into alternate formats, or content can provide explicit
					non-visual alternatives. Image and video technologies can and should provide support for automated
					transformation or for alternative versions as appropriate. Other technologies that are not as
					explicitly visual but that are likely to be rendered visually, such as text formats and often
					structured data, need to ensure that non-visual rendering can be as easily achieved as visual
					rendering.
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>
					<p>In the Web of Things many devices are small embedded systems, such as sensors or gateways.
					Many of these devices don't have a visual rendering UI at all (no display). 
					Web of Things and the Thing Description format does not describe how to render a UI 
					that can be used to interact with a Thing.
					</p><p>
					There are dedicated fields for titles and descriptions with support for multi-language
					text representations.
					These enable consumer implementations to generate a UI, based on the structured metadata,
					however the format only contains text strings - there are no layout descriptions, 
					colors, font sizes and other rendering hints.
					It is up to the consumer to provide a UI based on that metadata and the rendering capabilities of the consumer. 
					</p>

						The remaining questions of this section are not applicable for the Web of Things.

				<td>Content can be resized.</td>
				<td>Many users need content to be displayed larger than the default, not just because of un-sharp vision
					but also to mitigate other visual perception difficulties such as difficulty separating foreground
					from background. Depending on device and situation, content can also be displayed smaller than the
					author expects, so needs to be resizeable even if the intended default size is suitable.
					Technologies should provide features to allow user resize, without experiencing problems such as
					pixelation, clipping, excessive scrolling, etc. Support for resizing therefore requires a variety of
					features to be enabled by the technology.

				<td>Changing content presentation does not render it unreadable. </td>
				<td>Many accessibility requirements come down to allowing users to customize presentation. When
					presentation is changed in a way the author or designer did not anticipate, unexpected side effects
					often appear that create new problems. A frequent situation is when content is resized but the
					region for the content is not, causing the content to be clipped. Another is when regions resize but
					do not reposition, making it difficult to use the content at the new scale. Change of font
					attributes sometimes leads to a similar problem, such as when users change to a heavier font but the
					space allocated for characters does not increase. Technologies should provide features to ensure
					that change of display attributes does not create unintended side effects.

					disastrous). However, technologies that provide general animation features (even simple ones) may be
					unable to rule out author usages that create these effects. It is important for such technologies to
					provide a feature for users to stop animation, or prevent it until requested. More complex
					technologies should also provide means to mark potentially problematic content, warn users who have
					opted into the warning, and give users the option to skip or suppress problematic regions of
					content.

					providing a way for authors to define multiple color schemes, allowing more accessible schemes still

				<td>If a user inputs data that is not accepted by the system, a report of the issue is made and the user
					given an opportunity to correct the input. Such error messages are frequently provided at the top of

					corrected. Even if the error message is positioned closer to the control, it can be difficult to

					is optimal for them. Some use alternate versions of familiar hardware, such as keyboard-compatible
					and pointing devices, while others use less widespread types of hardware, such as voice recognition,
					single-switch devices, Braille displays, etc. Technologies should design content input and output
					methods to be agnostic to the specific hardware used, and provide application programming interfaces
					for supported hardware types such as keyboard and pointer so other hardware can effectively
					interact. Technologies should also emphasize the most hardware-neutral form of authoring feasible
					via more abstract events, and when providing hardware-specific features ensure that multiple types
					of hardware can be addressed.

				<td>For user interface objects that can have states, properties, or values, authors can set these and

				<td>Along with the role, many objects require information about properties, states, and values to be

					states are also specific to object type and provide information about a changeable condition such as
					checked status of a checkbox or visibility status of an object. All objects have values as well,
					which is often the text content but can be from another source, such as the user input in a form

					author but provide less built-in accessibility semantics, and sometimes do not provide a way to
					address accessibility APIs at all. Technologies that use imperative mechanisms to author content

				<td>Abbreviations, acronyms, initialisms, idioms, and jargon comprise usages of content that may not be

					meaning. Abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms are also often frequently pronounced different

					complexity or the effects of magnification. Supporting users to find relevant content quickly is
					important to effective use, and the best way to do this is to provide ways to identify regions of
					content easily. This can be done via headings but region type semantics is also particularly
					helpful. The main content region is the most important for users to find quickly, but other regions

					Because the semantics are well-defined, they can be broadly supported across the entire tool chain,
					including by assistive technologies. Imperative technologies, by contrast, don't define semantics in
