    <p>
      The <em>WoT Profile Specification</em> defines a Profiling Mechanism and an <em>HTTP Basic Profile</em>,
      which enables <em>out of the box interoperability</em>
      among things and devices. <em>Out of the box interoperability</em> implies,
      that devices can be integrated into various application scenarios without
      deep level adaptations. Typically only minor configuration operations are
      necessary (such as entering a network key, or IP address)
      to use the device in a certain scenario.
      These actions can be done by anyone without specific training.
    </p>
    The HTTP Basic Profile defines a set of <em>constraints
      and rules</em>, which compliant thing descriptions have to adopt
    to guarantee interoperability.
    </p>
    <p>
      These rules are prescriptive, to ensure that
      compliant implementations satisfy the semantic guarantees
      implied by them. We call this set of rules a <em>Profile</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>WoT Profile Specification</strong> as defined in
      this document serves two purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It defines a generic <strong><a href="#profiling-mechanism">Profiling
          Mechanism</a></strong> which provides a mechanism to describe a
        profile in an unambiguous way. This mechanism can be
        used to define additional profiles.
      </li>
      <li>In addition, it defines a <strong><a href="#http-basic-profile">HTTP Basic
            Profile</a></strong> of the Thing Description, which
        contains protocol binding rules for HTTP.
        <p>The <em>normative</em> HTTP Basic Profile is complemented by two 
          <em>informative profiles for events</em>: The <a href=#sec-http-sse-profile>HTTP SSE Profile</a> 
          and the <a href="#sec-http-webhook-profile">HTTP Webhook Profile</a>.
        
          <p>
          In the current version of this document these event bindings are provided in <em>informative</em>
          sections, to illustrate how these event mechanisms could be supported in other profiles.
        </p>
        <p>It is planned that future versions of this document <em>normatively</em> define 
          these event mechanisms.
        </p>

        <p>This specification defines a set of normative constraints
          that apply to <em>all</em> profiles defined by this document.</p>
        <p>
        <p>
          <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="profile-abstract-1">
            A TD that is compliant to the HTTP Basic Profile MUST adhere to
            both the common constraints and the protocol binding.</span>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Devices that constrain their use of the Thing Description to
      the HTTP Basic Profile can interoperate with each other
      out-of-the-box.
    </p>
    <p>Note that the HTTP Basic Profile is not exclusive. Device implementers are free to adopt
      other features of the Thing Description that go beyond the constraints
      of the HTTP Basic Profile, however the interoperability guarantees of the HTTP Basic Profile
      hold only for the HTTP Basic Profile subset.
    </p>
    <p>Future versions of this document may contain other profiles,
      e.g. a profile for digital twins and a profile for resource constrained devices.</p>

      <h3>Motivation for a Profile</h3>
    </section>

    <p>
    <p id="profile-abstract-2">
      The W3C WoT Thing Architecture [[wot-architecture11]] and
      WoT Thing Description [[wot-thing-description11]] define a
      powerful description mechanism and a format to describe
      myriads of very different devices, which may be connected
      over various protocols.
      The format is very flexible and open
      and puts very few normative requirements on devices that
      implement it.</p>

    <p>
      However, this flexibility de-facto prevents
      interoperability, since, without additional <strong>rules</strong>,
      it allows implementers to make many choices that do not
      provide <strong>guarantees</strong> of common behavior
      between implementations.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section id='sotd'></section>

  <section id="intro">
    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The W3C WoT Architecture [[wot-architecture11]] and the WoT
      Thing Description [[wot-thing-description11]]
      have been developed as a versatile format, that allows
      describing the interactions between multiple devices and
      protocols.

    </p>
    <p>
      This flexibility permits an easy integration of new device
      types and protocols, however it risks interoperability,
      since there are <em>no guarantees</em> that two devices
      which are formally spec-compliant, will be able to
      communicate.
    </p>
    <p>To increase adoption of the WoT specifications,
      interoperability between on premise devices, edge devices
      and the cloud is essential. Even if every manufacturer is
      implementing the current Thing Description specification in
      full flexibility, there is no interoperability guarantee;
      many choices are still left to the implementations and there
      are very few normative requirements that a device has to
      fulfill.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Deployment Scenarios</h3>

      <p>A Thing Description can be used in two fundamentally
        different deployment scenarios:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a "brown-field" scenario, where it is created
          to describe the interactions with existing systems.</li>

        <li>a "green-field" scenario, where a device model
          and a thing description are developed together.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For green field deployments, where the implementations
        are being carried out and corresponding thing
        descriptions are being created, it is easier to achieve
        full interoperability by using a small, extensible <a href="#http-basic-profile">HTTP Basic
          Profile</a>.
      </p>

      <p>In the brown field area, due to the nature of
        existing deployments and protocols, a broad spectrum of
        variations and potentially high complexity of thing
        descriptions inhibits interoperability and will most
        likely lead to additional profiles of the <a>WoT Thing Description</a>
        and domain-specific thing consumer implementations.</p>

      <p>
        The WoT HTTP Basic Profile can be used by green field
        deployments and gives guidance to new implementers of
        the WoT specifications.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Use Cases -->
    <section id="profile-use-cases">
      <h2>Use Cases and Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        A set of over 30 use cases for the Web of Things were contributed by stakeholders
        from multiple industries for various application domains.
        These have been published in the WoT Use Cases and Requirements document [[wot-usecases]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on these use cases a set of requirements have been derived which drive the development
        of the W3C Web of Things specification family.
        Several of these domains require easy integration of devices from multiple vendors,
        in other words, out-of-the-box interoperability.
        However, the descriptive approach taken by the WoT specifications generally leads
        to a large variety of different protocols and data formats,
        which can work against out-of-the box interoperability.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a WoT Thing Description (TD) can in theory include a description based on a
        networking protocol unknown to a device that wishes to connect to it.
        To ensure interoperability without additional customization (e.g. by writing software or
        performing complex setup or configuration steps),
        the range of such choices needs to be limited to a finite set so that a consumer
        of a Thing Description can be sure it will be able to interact with any possible Thing.
        A finite set of customization choices is also important for implementing devices with a fixed code base.
        Defining such constraints leads to the profile mechanism and the HTTP Basic Profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to multiple vertical use cases that will use HTTP(S) for their implementations,
        there are horizontal use cases that are addressed by this profile specification.
        The primary focus is to enable Multi-Vendor system integration with out of the box interoperability.
      </p>
      <section id="profile-use-case-MVSE">
        <h2>Multi-Vendor System Integration - Out of the box interoperability</h2>
        Users of devices want to process data from all devices that conform to a class of devices in a uniform way.
        They need a guarantee that they are able to correctly interact with all affordances of the Thing
        that complies with this class of devices.
        Different interpretations of the same Thing Description, that lead to different behaviour, should not be
        possible.
        Users want to integrate devices in existing scenarios out of the box, i.e. with close to zero configuration
        tasks.
      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="why-profile">
      <h2 id="why-define-a-profile">
        Why a <a>Profile</a>?
      </h2>

      <p>
        During the recent WoT Plugfests there were many
        de-facto agreements on the use of a small constrained
        subset of interaction patterns and protocol choices.
        These de-facto agreements select a common subset of the
        <a>WoT Thing Description</a>, based on
        proven interoperability among manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="profile-why-a-basic-profile-1-x">
          The <a href="#http-basic-profile">HTTP Basic Profile</a> contains additional
          normative requirements that MUST be satisfied by devices
          to be compliant to the profile.</span>
      </p>

        <figcaption>WoT HTTP Basic Profile - A Subset of Affordances</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Adoption of the <a href="#http-basic-profile">HTTP Basic Profile</a> will
        significantly limit the implementation burden of device
        and cloud implementors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The HTTP Basic Profile was defined with the
        following main goals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>guarantee interoperability among all
          implementations of the profile.</li>
        <li>limit the implementation complexity.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It makes choices on the required metadata fields as
        well as the supported interactions and protocol
        endpoints. It introduces some constraints on data
        schemas for properties and actions which are required
        for resource constrained devices in real-world
        deployments. The format does not forbid the use of
        additional elements of the <a>WoT Thing Description</a> for vendor specific
        extensions, however this will impact interoperability.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability">Out-of-the-box
        interoperability</h2>
      <p>
        Devices, which implement the <a href="#http-basic-profile">HTTP Basic Profile</a>, are <strong>out-of-the-box
          interoperable</strong> with other HTTP Basic Profile
        compliant devices. Furthermore, the HTTP Basic Profile
        simplifies device validation and compliance testing
        since a corresponding conformance test suite can be
        defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following classification adopts the terminology as described in the
        "H2020 – CREATE-IoT Project - Recommendations for commonalities and
        interoperability profiles of IoT platforms" [[?H2020-CREATE-IoT]]
        report.
        The definitions below have been adapted to reflect the scope of the WoT profile.
      </p>
      <h3 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability-technical-interop">Technical Interoperability</h3>
      <p><em>Technical Interoperability</em> is usually associated with communication protocols and the
        infrastructure needed for those protocols to operate. This implies agreeing on a common protocol
        (e.g. HTTP / TCP/IP) and providing additional clarifications, where required.
      </p>

      <h3 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability-syntactic-interop">Syntactic Interoperability</h3>
      <p><em>Syntactic Interoperability</em> is usually associated with data formats and encodings along with
        techniques for compressing them. Examples for these formats and encodings in the WoT are JSON,
        XML, JSON-LD, UTF-8 payloads.
      </p>
      <h3 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability-semantic-interop">Semantic Interoperability</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Semantic Interoperability</em> is associated with a common understanding of the behavior of communication
        partners.
        In the profile context, it includes a common interpretation of (synchronous and asynchronous) action semantics,
        a common event model, how to set/get multiple properties, writable properties,
        a common error model and error messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Domain specific ontologies, e.g. semantic interop of automotive and medical devices exceed the scope of the
        profile.
      </p>
      <h3 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability-organisational-interop">Organisational Interoperability</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Organisational Interoperability</em> in the profile context implies that any consumer,
        which conforms with a given profile can interact with any Thing which conforms
        with the same profile, without additional customization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organisational Interoperability also requires commonly agreed approaches to security,
        trust and privacy, i.e. a consumer is provided access to Things only, when these
        common terms and conditions are applied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Devices created by various engineers, vendors and SDOs that satisfy the requirements
        of the profile specification can be integrated with compliant consumers without additional customization.
        This works across infrastructures, regions and cultures.

          These links enable consumers to interpret linked content that is provided by the link target in an unambiguous way.
          This interpretation is a "best effort" mechanism, that depends on the capabilities of the consumer.
          A consumer with a browser could render HTML content, a consumer with a PDF engine can display PDF content,
          a consumer with a dot-matrix display only can display icons.
        </p>
        <p>For consumers that can render images or documents this implies to display appropriate documentation
          to a human reader.</p>
        <p>Consumers that are capable of working with nested things and thing model structures are able
          to navigate between things and thing models in a well defined way.</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Webhooks are a mechanism for Consumers to subscribe to events emitted by a Web Thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mechanism is scalable and supports Consumers that receive events from
        multiple Things. Consumers implement a Webhook listener that is handling the event
        streams generated by Things.
      </p>
      <p>
	 A Webhook is similar to a callback mechanism in programming languages. Consumers can
	 subscribe to events they are interested in by registering a listener with the event endpoint.
	 When the event condition occurs, the WebThing
	 is notifying all listeners with a corresponding event message, which is transmitted over HTTP(s). 
	 The event message contains details about the event, such as timestamp, event type, 
	 event source etc. in the data payload.
      </p><p>
	 Depending on the deployment scenarios and integration requirements for existing consumers, it may be 
	 required to use specific data payload formats (e.g. Cloud Events).
	 When a listener receives an event message in a data payload, in many cases it just acknowledges the 
	 successful reception of the event.
	 Additionally, it may provide a dataResponse payload, which provides a back-channel that can be used 
	 to communicate further details from the consumer to the WebThing. 
      </p> 
      <p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="http-webhook-profile-protocol-binding-events-1">
          Depending on the use case, a single listener for multiple things and multiple
          event types MAY be used.</span>
      </p>
      <p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="http-webhook-profile-protocol-binding-events-2">
          To minimize network traffic, the same listerner MUST NOT perform multiple subscriptions to the same listener.</span>

              In order to subscribe to <em>all</em> events emitted by a Web Thing, a
