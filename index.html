    <p>
      The <em>WoT Profile Specification</em> defines a Profiling Mechanism and a <em>WoT Core Profile</em>,
      which enables <em>out of the box interoperability</em>
      among things and devices. <em>Out of the box interoperability</em> implies,
      that devices can be integrated into various application scenarios without
      deep level adaptations. Typically only minor configuration operations are
      necessary (such as entering a network key, or IP address)
      to use the device in a certain scenario.
      These actions can be done by anyone without specific training.
    </p>
      The <a>WoT Core Profile</a> defines a set of <em>constraints
      and rules</em>, which compliant thing descriptions have to adopt
      to guarantee interoperability.
    </p>
    <p>
      These rules are prescriptive, to ensure that
      compliant implementations satisfy the semantic guarantees
      implied by them. We call this set of rules a <em>Profile</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>WoT Profile Specification</strong> as defined in
      this document serves two purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It defines a generic <strong>Profiling
          Mechanism</strong> which provides a mechanism to describe a
        profile in an unambiguous way. This mechanism can be
        used to define additional profiles.
      </li>
      <li>In addition, it defines a <strong><a>WoT Core
            Profile</a></strong> of the Thing Description, which
        consists of a core data model and protocol
        binding rules. The <a>WoT Core
          Profile</a> formalizes the results of several PlugFests
        that were conducted by the WoT Interest Group and of
        tests that were conducted as part of the development.
        <p>
          This document incudes a binding of the core data model to
          HTTP(S) and selected notification sub-protocols.
          The core data model can be bound to other protocols -
          it is expected that bindings to other protocols (e.g. MQTT, CoAP)
          will be defined in the near future.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="profile-abstract-1">
          A TD that is compliant to the <a>core profile</a> MUST adhere to
          both the constraints on the data model and the protocol binding.
          </span>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Devices that constrain their use of the Thing Description to
      the <a>WoT Core Profile</a> can interoperate with each other
      out-of-the-box.
    </p>
    <p>Note that the core profile is not exclusive. Device implementers are free to adopt
      other features of the thing description that go beyond the constraints
      of the core profile, however the interoperability guarantees of the core profile
      hold only for the <a>WoT Core Profile</a> subset.

    <section class="ednote">
      The name <em>WoT Core Profile</em> is still under discussion in the group and is used as a working title.
      It is subject to change after the profile specification has reached a certain level of maturity.

      <h3>Motivation for a Profile</h3>
    </section>

    <p>
      <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="profile-abstract-2">
      The W3C WoT Thing Architecture [[wot-architecture]] and
      WoT Thing Description [[wot-thing-description]] define a
      powerful description mechanism and a format to describe
      myriads of very different devices, which may be connected
      over various protocols.
      </span>
      The format is very flexible and open
      and puts very few normative requirements on devices that
      implement it.</p>

    <p>
      However, this flexibility de-facto prevents
      interoperability, since, without additional <strong>rules</strong>,
      it allows implementers to make many choices that do not
      provide <strong>guarantees</strong> of common behavior
      between implementations.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section id='sotd'></section>

  <section id="intro">
    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The W3C WoT Architecture [[wot-architecture]] and the WoT
      Thing Description [[wot-thing-description]]
      have been developed as a versatile format, that allows
      describing the interactions between multiple devices and
      protocols.

    </p>
    <p>
      This flexibility permits an easy integration of new device
      types and protocols, however it risks interoperability,
      since there are <em>no guarantees</em> that two devices
      which are formally spec-compliant, will be able to
      communicate.
    </p>
    <p>To increase adoption of the WoT specifications,
      interoperability between on premise devices, edge devices
      and the cloud is essential. Even if every manufacturer is
      implementing the current Thing Description specification in
      full flexibility, there is no interoperability guarantee;
      many choices are still left to the implementations and there
      are very few normative requirements that a device has to
      fulfill.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Deployment Scenarios</h3>

      <p>A Thing Description can be used in two fundamentally
        different deployment scenarios:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a "brown-field" scenario, where it is created
          to describe the interactions with existing systems.</li>

        <li>a "green-field" scenario, where a device model
          and a thing description are developed together.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For green field deployments, where the implementations
        are being carried out and corresponding thing
        descriptions are being created, it is easier to achieve
        full interoperability by using a small, extensible <a>Core
          Profile</a>.
      </p>

      <p>In the brown field area, due to the nature of
        existing deployments and protocols, a broad spectrum of
        variations and potentially high complexity of thing
        descriptions inhibits interoperability and will most
        likely lead to additional profiles of the <a>WoT Thing Description</a>
        and domain-specific thing consumer implementations.</p>

      <p>
        The WoT <a>Core Profile</a> can be used by green field
        deployments and gives guidance to new implementers of
        the WoT specifications. It has already proved in
        brown-field scenarios in the PlugFests, where existing
        devices, that already existed as products, prototypes or
        demonstrators, were described with Thing Descriptions
        that are constrained to the <a>Core Profile</a>.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section id="why-profile">
      <h2 id="why-define-a-core-profile">
        Why a <a>Core Profile</a>?
      </h2>

      <p>
        During the recent WoT PlugFests there were many
        de-facto agreements on the use of a small constrained
        subset of interaction patterns and protocol choices.
        These de-facto agreements select a common subset of the
        <a>WoT Thing Description</a>, based on
        proven interoperability among manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of this specification is to formalize these
        agreements by defining a <strong><a>WoT Core
            Profile</a></strong> based on the choices that were made by
        the implementers of PlugFest devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="profile-1.2-why-a-core-profile-1">
        The <a>WoT Core Profile</a> contains additional
        normative requirements that MUST be satisfied by devices
        to be compliant to the profile.
        </span>
      </p>

        <figcaption>WoT Core Profile - A Subset of Affordances</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Adoption of the <a>WoT Core Profile</a> will
        significantly limit the implementation burden of device
        and cloud implementors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a>WoT Core Profile</a> was defined with the
        following main goals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>guarantee interoperability among all
          implementations of the profile.</li>
        <li>limit the implementation complexity for
          resource constrained devices.</li>
        <li>ensure that a thing description is also useful
          for a human reader.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It makes choices on the required metadata fields as
        well as the supported interactions and protocol
        endpoints. It introduces some constraints on data
        schemas for properties and actions which are required
        for resource constrained devices in real-world
        deployments. The format does not forbid the use of
        additional elements of the <a>WoT Thing Description</a> for vendor specific
        extensions, however this will impact interoperability.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability">Out-of-the-box
        interoperability</h2>
      <p>
        Devices, which implement the <a>Core Profile</a>, are <strong>out-of-the-box
          interoperable</strong> with other <a>Core Profile</a>
        compliant devices. Furthermore, the <a>Core Profile</a>
        simplifies device validation and compliance testing
        since a corresponding conformance test suite can be
        defined.
      </p>
      <section class="note">
        It is also a goal of the <em>WoT Core Profile</em> to
        ensure that compliant files can be understood by humans
        - therefore descriptions, dates, and author fields are
        either mandatory or highly recommended.

          If any of the operations defined above are unsuccessful then
          the Web Thing MUST send an HTTP response with an HTTP error code which
          describes the reason for the failure. It is RECOMMENDED that error
          responses use one of the following HTTP error codes:
          </span>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>400 Bad Request</code></li>
          <li><code>401 Unauthorized</code></li>
          <li><code>403 Forbidden</code></li>

          <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="profile-5.2.4-thing-protocol-binding-error-responses-2">
          Web Things MAY respond with other valid HTTP error codes
          (e.g. <code>418 I'm a teapot</code>),
          </span>
          <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="profile-5.2.4-thing-protocol-binding-error-responses-3">
          but Consumers MAY interpret those error codes as a generic <code>4xx</code> or <code>5xx</code>
          error with no special defined behaviour.

          If we define the finite set of error responses as above then we
          should also define what a Consumer should do if it receives a 3xx
          redirect type response.
