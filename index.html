    <p>
      The <em>WoT Profile Specification</em> defines a Profiling Mechanism and a <em>HTTP Baseline Profile</em>,
      which enables <em>out of the box interoperability</em>
      among things and devices. <em>Out of the box interoperability</em> implies,
      that devices can be integrated into various application scenarios without
      deep level adaptations. Typically only minor configuration operations are
      necessary (such as entering a network key, or IP address)
      to use the device in a certain scenario.
      These actions can be done by anyone without specific training.
    </p>
    The <a>HTTP Baseline Profile</a> defines a set of <em>constraints
      and rules</em>, which compliant thing descriptions have to adopt
    to guarantee interoperability.
    </p>
    <p>
      These rules are prescriptive, to ensure that
      compliant implementations satisfy the semantic guarantees
      implied by them. We call this set of rules a <em>Profile</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>WoT Profile Specification</strong> as defined in
      this document serves two purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It defines a generic <strong>Profiling
          Mechanism</strong> which provides a mechanism to describe a
        profile in an unambiguous way. This mechanism can be
        used to define additional profiles.
      </li>
      <li>In addition, it defines a <strong><a>HTTP Baseline
            Profile</a></strong> of the Thing Description, which
        contains protocol binding rules for HTTP. The <a>HTTP Baseline
          Profile</a> formalizes the results of several PlugFests
        that were conducted by the WoT Interest Group and of
        tests that were conducted as part of the development.
        <p>The <em>normative</em> HTTP Baseline Profile is complemented by two 
          <em>informative profiles for events</em>: The <a href=#sec-http-sse-profile>HTTP SSE Profile</a> 
          and the <a href="#sec-http-webhook-profile">HTTP Webhook Profile</a>.
        
          <p>
          In the current version of this document these event bindings are provided in <em>informative</em>
          sections, to illustrate how these event mechanisms could be supported in other profiles.
        </p>
        <p>It is planned that future versions of this document <em>normatively</em> define 
          these event mechanisms.
        </p>

        <p>This specification defines a set of normative constraints
          that apply to <em>all</em> profiles defined by this document.</p>
        <p>
        <p>
          <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="profile-abstract-1">
            A TD that is compliant to the <a>HTTP baseline profile</a> MUST adhere to
            both the common constraints and the protocol binding.</span>
        </p>     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Devices that constrain their use of the Thing Description to
      the <a>HTTP Baseline Profile</a> can interoperate with each other
      out-of-the-box.
    </p>
    <p>Note that the HTTP Baseline Profile is not exclusive. Device implementers are free to adopt
      other features of the Thing Description that go beyond the constraints
      of the HTTP Baseline Profile, however the interoperability guarantees of the HTTP Baseline Profile
      hold only for the <a>HTTP Baseline Profile</a> subset.
    </p>
    <p>Future versions of this document may contain other profiles,
      e.g. a profile for digital twins and a profile for resource constrained devices.</p>

      <h3>Motivation for a Profile</h3>
    </section>

    <p>
    <p id="profile-abstract-2">
      The W3C WoT Thing Architecture [[wot-architecture11]] and
      WoT Thing Description [[wot-thing-description11]] define a
      powerful description mechanism and a format to describe
      myriads of very different devices, which may be connected
      over various protocols.
      The format is very flexible and open
      and puts very few normative requirements on devices that
      implement it.</p>

    <p>
      However, this flexibility de-facto prevents
      interoperability, since, without additional <strong>rules</strong>,
      it allows implementers to make many choices that do not
      provide <strong>guarantees</strong> of common behavior
      between implementations.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section id='sotd'></section>

  <section id="intro">
    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The W3C WoT Architecture [[wot-architecture11]] and the WoT
      Thing Description [[wot-thing-description11]]
      have been developed as a versatile format, that allows
      describing the interactions between multiple devices and
      protocols.

    </p>
    <p>
      This flexibility permits an easy integration of new device
      types and protocols, however it risks interoperability,
      since there are <em>no guarantees</em> that two devices
      which are formally spec-compliant, will be able to
      communicate.
    </p>
    <p>To increase adoption of the WoT specifications,
      interoperability between on premise devices, edge devices
      and the cloud is essential. Even if every manufacturer is
      implementing the current Thing Description specification in
      full flexibility, there is no interoperability guarantee;
      many choices are still left to the implementations and there
      are very few normative requirements that a device has to
      fulfill.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Deployment Scenarios</h3>

      <p>A Thing Description can be used in two fundamentally
        different deployment scenarios:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a "brown-field" scenario, where it is created
          to describe the interactions with existing systems.</li>

        <li>a "green-field" scenario, where a device model
          and a thing description are developed together.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For green field deployments, where the implementations
        are being carried out and corresponding thing
        descriptions are being created, it is easier to achieve
        full interoperability by using a small, extensible <a>Baseline
          Profile</a>.
      </p>

      <p>In the brown field area, due to the nature of
        existing deployments and protocols, a broad spectrum of
        variations and potentially high complexity of thing
        descriptions inhibits interoperability and will most
        likely lead to additional profiles of the <a>WoT Thing Description</a>
        and domain-specific thing consumer implementations.</p>

      <p>
        The WoT <a>HTTP Baseline Profile</a> can be used by green field
        deployments and gives guidance to new implementers of
        the WoT specifications. It has already demonstrated in
        brown-field scenarios in the Plugfests, where existing
        devices that already existed as products, prototypes or
        demonstrators, were described with Thing Descriptions
        that are constrained to the <a>HTTP Baseline Profile</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Use Cases -->
    <section id="profile-use-cases">
      <h2>Summary of Use Cases and Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        A set of over 30 use cases for the Web of Things were contributed by stakeholders
        from multiple industries for various application domains.
        These have been published in the WoT Use Cases and Requirements document [[wot-usecases]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on these use cases a set of requirements have been derived which drive the development
        of the W3C Web of Things specification family.
        Several of these domains require easy integration of devices from multiple vendors,
        in other words, out-of-the-box interoperability.
        However, the descriptive approach taken by the WoT specifications generally leads
        to a large variety of different protocols and data formats,
        which can work against out-of-the box interoperability.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a WoT Thing Description (TD) can in theory include a description based on a
        networking protocol unknown to a device that wishes to connect to it.
        To ensure interoperability without additional customization (e.g. by writing software or
        performing complex setup or configuration steps),
        the range of such choices needs to be limited to a finite set so that a consumer
        of a Thing Description can be sure it will be able to interact with any possible Thing.
        A finite set of customization choices is also important for implementing devices with a fixed code base.
        Defining such constraints leads to the profile mechanism and the HTTP Baseline Profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to multiple vertical use cases that will use HTTP(S) for their implementations,
        there are horizontal use cases that are addressed by this profile specification.
        The primary focus is to enable Multi-Vendor system integration with out of the box interoperability.
      </p>
      <section id="profile-use-case-MVSE">
        <h2>Multi-Vendor System Integration - Out of the box interoperability</h2>
        Users of devices want to process data from all devices that conform to a class of devices in a uniform way.
        They need a guarantee that they are able to correctly interact with all affordances of the Thing
        that complies with this class of devices.
        Different interpretations of the same Thing Description, that lead to different behaviour, should not be
        possible.
        Users want to integrate devices in existing scenarios out of the box, i.e. with close to zero configuration
        tasks.
      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="why-profile">
      <h2 id="why-define-a-profile">
        Why a <a>Profile</a>?
      </h2>

      <p>
        During the recent WoT Plugfests there were many
        de-facto agreements on the use of a small constrained
        subset of interaction patterns and protocol choices.
        These de-facto agreements select a common subset of the
        <a>WoT Thing Description</a>, based on
        proven interoperability among manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of this specification is to formalize these
        agreements by defining a set of <strong>HTTP
          Profiles</strong> based on the choices that were made by
        the implementers of Plugfest devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="profile-why-a-baseline-profile-1-x">
          The <a>HTTP Baseline Profile</a> contains additional
          normative requirements that MUST be satisfied by devices
          to be compliant to the profile.</span>

      </figure>
      <p>
        Adoption of the <a>HTTP Baseline Profile</a> will
        significantly limit the implementation burden of device
        and cloud implementors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a>HTTP Baseline Profile</a> was defined with the
        following main goals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>guarantee interoperability among all
          implementations of the profile.</li>
        <li>limit the implementation complexity.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It makes choices on the required metadata fields as
        well as the supported interactions and protocol
        endpoints. It introduces some constraints on data
        schemas for properties and actions which are required
        for resource constrained devices in real-world
        deployments. The format does not forbid the use of
        additional elements of the <a>WoT Thing Description</a> for vendor specific
        extensions, however this will impact interoperability.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability">Out-of-the-box
        interoperability</h2>
      <p>
        Devices, which implement the <a>HTTP Baseline Profile</a>, are <strong>out-of-the-box
          interoperable</strong> with other <a>HTTP Baseline Profile</a>
        compliant devices. Furthermore, the <a>HTTP Baseline Profile</a>
        simplifies device validation and compliance testing
        since a corresponding conformance test suite can be
        defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following classification adopts the terminology as described in the
        "H2020 – CREATE-IoT Project - Recommendations for commonalities and
        interoperability profiles of IoT platforms" [[?H2020-CREATE-IoT]]
        report.
        The definitions below have been adapted to reflect the scope of the WoT profile.
      </p>
      <h3 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability-technical-interop">Technical Interoperability</h3>
      <p><em>Technical Interoperability</em> is usually associated with communication protocols and the
        infrastructure needed for those protocols to operate. This implies agreeing on a common protocol
        (e.g. HTTP / TCP/IP) and providing additional clarifications, where required.
      </p>

      <h3 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability-syntactic-interop">Syntactic Interoperability</h3>
      <p><em>Syntactic Interoperability</em> is usually associated with data formats and encodings along with
        techniques for compressing them. Examples for these formats and encodings in the WoT are JSON,
        XML, JSON-LD, UTF-8 payloads.
      </p>
      <h3 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability-technical-interop">Semantic Interoperability</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Semantic Interoperability</em> is associated with a common understanding of the behavior of communication
        partners.
        In the profile context, it includes a common interpretation of (synchronous and asynchronous) action semantics,
        a common event model, how to set/get multiple properties, writable properties,
        a common error model and error messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Domain specific ontologies, e.g. semantic interop of automotive and medical devices exceed the scope of the
        profile.
      </p>
      <h3 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability-organisational-interop">Organisational Interoperability</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Organisational Interoperability</em> in the profile context implies that any consumer,
        which conforms with a given profile can interact with any Thing which conforms
        with the same profile, without additional customization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organisational Interoperability also requires commonly agreed approaches to security,
        trust and privacy, i.e. a consumer is provided access to Things only, when these
        common terms and conditions are applied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Devices created by various engineers, vendors and SDOs that satisfy the requirements
        of the profile specification can be integrated with compliant consumers without additional customization.
        This works across infrastructures, regions and cultures.

      and should be able to correctly interact with all affordances of the Thing such a TD describes.
    </p>

    This implies that a profile has three parts:
    <ul>
      <li>Restrictions on TDs</li>
      <li>Implementation requirements, constraints and behavioral assertions for Consumers</li>
      <li>Implementation requirements, constraints and behavioral assertions on Things</li>
    </ul>

    <section class="note">
      Note: The WoT HTTP Baseline Profile does not prevent a TD to have forms for additional protocols,
      but these can be ignored by compliant consumers, and could be removed without
      affecting profile conformance and compatibility.
      This may be useful for consumers that support multiple profiles.

    <h3>Limit and reduce complexity</h3>
    <!-- Supporters: Oracle, Siemens, Ben, Cristiano -->
    <p>
      Complexity addresses at least the following two things to simplify the development and
      reduce the implementation effort:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Implementation complexity on a thing and consumer, e.g. eliminating the need of RDF processing,
        but still permitting semantic annotations.</li>
      <li>Simplifying thing description to have fewer variations.</li>
      <li>Limiting the effort for JSON implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>No Ambiguities, select single choice</h3>
    <!-- Supporters: Oracle, Fujitsu, Intel, Ben, Cristiano, Ege -->
    <p>
      Get rid of ambiguities, i.e. clarify specifications to define interpretation of a TD and behavior of the thing and
      consumer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples are the choice of properties vs. actions, use of PUT or POST for HTTP, observe protocols.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Developer guidance</h3>
    <!-- Supporters: Fujitsu, Siemens, Intel, Oracle, Ben, Cristiano-->
    <p>
      A profile should help define what needs to be implemented. This requirement also includes behavioral goals and
      recommendations about best practice for the implementation of Consumers and Things.
    </p>
    <h3>Multiple profiles (mechanism)</h3>
    <!-- Supporters: Intel, Siemens, Ben, Cristiano, Hitachi -->
    <p>
      The mechanism used to indicate that a TD satisfies a profile should be general enough to indicate
      the TD satisfies the requirements for multiple profiles.
    </p>
 
    <h3>Composable profiles</h3>
    <!-- Proposer: Intel, Hitachi, Siemens, Ben(*)-->
    <p>
      It should be possible to combine multiple profiles both for production and consumption:
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be possible to indicate that a consumer can ingest TDs that satisfy one or more profiles, even if each
      TDs
      individually only satisfies one profile. For example, a Smart Building may need to use both "constrained" devices
      and
      "unconstrained" devices. A gateway consuming TDs should be able to ingest TDs designed for both the constrained
      and unconstrained
      contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Thing that satisfies all the requirements for multiple TDs (for example, a device using protocols common to two
      different usage contexts) should be able to indicate that.
    </p>

    <h3>Validatible TDs</h3>
    <!-- Supporters: Intel, Oracle, Ben, Cristiano -->
    <p>
      Whether or not a TD satisfies the requirements of a given profile should be verifiable with automated tools.
      We can use the existing TD JSDON Schema as a basis and reuse the existing tooling (TD-playground)
    </p>
    <h3>Identification of profiles</h3>
    <!-- Supporters: Intel, Siemens, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Ben, Oracle -->
    <p>
      There should be a mechanism to identify which profiles a TD satisfies. This mechanism should be intrinsic to a TD,
      i.e. be in-band.
    </p>

    <h3>Finite set of features and capabilities</h3>
    <!-- Supporters: Intel, Oracle, Fujitsu, Ben(*), IRI -->
    <p>
      A profile should limit the number of options, for example the set of possible protocols, 
      to a finite set, so that a consumer can consume any TD in a given profile with 
      a finite and static code base.

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Webhooks are a mechanism for Consumers to subscribe to events emitted by a Web Thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mechanism is scalable and supports Consumers that receive events from
        multiple Things. Consumers implement a Webhook listener that is handling the event
        streams generated by Things.

      </p>
      <p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="http-webhook-profile-protocol-binding-events-1">
