        <p>The W3C WoT Thing Architecture [[wot-architecture]] and
            WoT Thing Description [[wot-thing-description]] define a
            powerful description mechanism and a format to describe
            myriads of very different devices, which may be connected
            over various protocols. The format is very flexible and open
            and puts very few normative requirements on devices that
            implement it.</p>

        <p>
            However, this flexibility de-facto prevents
            interoperability, since, without additional <strong>rules</strong>,
            it allows implementers to make many choices that do not
            provide <strong>guarantees</strong> of common behavior
            between implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
            These rules have to be prescriptive, to ensure that
            compliant implementations satisfy the semantic guarantees,
            that are implied by them. We call this set of rules a <a>Profile</a>.
        
        <p>
            The <strong>WoT Profile Specification</strong> as defined in
            the present document serves two purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It defines a generic <strong>Profiling
                    Mechanism</strong> which provides a mechanism to describe a
                profile in an unambiguous way. This mechanism can be
                used to define additional profiles.
            </li>
            <li>In addition it defines a <strong><a>Core
                        Profile</a></strong> of the Thing Description for use with
                the HTTP(S) and selected notification protocols. The <a>Core
                    Profile</a> formalizes the results of several plug-fests
                that were conducted by the WoT Interest Group and of
                tests that were conducted as part of the development. It
                is expected that additional profiles for thing templates
                and other protocols will be defined in the near future.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Devices that constrain their use of the Thing Description to
            the <a>WoT Core Profile</a> can interoperate with each other
            out-of-the-box.
        </p>
        <p>A later version of this document will define additional
            profiles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Thing Template Profile</strong>
                <p>
                    The <a>Thing Template Profile</a> enables to apply
                    the vocabulary of the <a>Thing Description</a>
                    Specification for defining a common interface, that
                    can be implemented by different things. It selects
                    an appropriate subset to describe <strong>classes</strong>
                    of things that share the same data model.
                </p></li>

            <li><strong>Digital Twin Profile</strong>
                <p>
                    The <a>Digital Twin Profile</a> allows defining a
                    virtual model of a thing or a group of things.
                </p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Profiles are is not exclusive, they can overlap or
            include others.

        <!--  h1 id="w3c-web-of-things-a-wot--profile-for-http-rest">W3C Web of Things: A WoT <a>Core Profile</a> for HTTP/REST</h1-->

        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            The W3C WoT Architecture [[wot-architecture]] and the WoT
            Thing Description [[wot-thing-description]] (<a
                href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description">https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description</a>)
            has been developed as a versatile format, that allows
            describing the interactions between multiple devices and
            protocols.

        </p>
        <p>
            This flexibility permits an easy integration of new device
            types and protocols, however it risks interoperability,
            since there are <em>no guarantees</em> that two devices
            which are formally spec-compliant, will be able to
            communicate.
        </p>
        <p>To increase adoption of the WoT specifications,
            interoperability between on premise devices, edge devices
            and the cloud is essential. Even if every manufacturer is
            implementing the current Thing Description specification in
            full flexibility, there is no interoperability guarantee;
            many choices are still left to the implementations and there
            are very few normative requirements that a device has to
            fulfill.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Deployment Scenarios</h3>

            <p>A Thing Description can be used in two fundamentally
                different deployment scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a "brown-field" scenario, where it is created
                    to describe the interactions with existing systems.</li>

                <li>a "green-field" scenario, where a device model
                    and a thing description are developed together.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                For green field deployments, where the implementations
                are being carried out and corresponding thing
                descriptions are being created, it is easier to achieve
                full interoperability by using a small, extensible <a>Core
                    Profile</a>.
            </p>

            <p>In the brown field area, due to the nature of
                existing deployments and protocols, a broad spectrum of
                variations and potentially high complexity of thing
                descriptions inhibits interoperability and will most
                likely lead to additional profiles of the TD and
                domain-specific thing consumer implementations.</p>

            <p>
                The WoT <a>Core Profile</a> can be used by green field
                deployments and gives guidance to new implementers of
                the WoT specifications. It has already proved in
                brown-field scenarios in the plug-fests, where existing
                devices, that already existed as products, prototypes or
                demonstrators, were described with Thing Descriptions
                that are constrained to the <a>Core Profile</a>.
            </p>

        </section>
        <section id="why-profile">
            <h2 id="why-define-a-core-profile">
                Why a <a>Core Profile</a>?
            </h2>

            <p>
                During the recent WoT plug-fests there were many
                de-facto agreements on the use of a small constrained
                subset of interaction patterns and protocol choices.
                These de-facto agreements select a common subset of the
                WoT <a>Thing Description specification</a>, based on
                proven interoperability among manufacturers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The aim of this specification is to formalize these
                agreements by defining a <strong>WoT <a>Core
                        Profile</a></strong> based on the choices that were made by
                the implementers of plug fest devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a>WoT Core Profile</a> contains additional
                normative requirements that MUST be satisfied by devices
                to be compliant to the profile.
            </p>
            <figure id="WoT Core Profile">

                <figcaption>WoT Core Profile</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Adoption of the <a>WoT Core Profile</a> will
                significantly limit the implementation burden of device
                and cloud implementors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a>WoT Core Profile</a> was defined with the
                following main goals:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>guarantee interoperability among all
                    implementations of the profile.</li>
                <li>limit the implementation complexity for
                    resource constrained devices.</li>
                <li>ensure that a thing description is also useful
                    for a human reader.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It makes choices on the required metadata fields as
                well as the supported interactions and protocol
                endpoints. It introduces some constraints on data
                schemas for properties and actions which are required
                for resource constrained devices in real-world
                deployments. The format does not forbid the use of
                additional elements of the TD for vendor specific
                extensions, however this will impact interoperability.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability">Out-of-the-box
                interoperability</h2>
            <p>
                Devices, which implement the <a>Core Profile</a>, are <strong>out-of-the-box
                    interoperable</strong> with other <a>Core Profile</a>em>
                compliant devices. Furthermore, the <a>Core Profile</a>
                simplifies device validation and compliance testing
                since a corresponding conformance test suite can be
                defined.
            </p>
            <section class="note">
                It is also a goal of the <a>WoT Core Profile</a> to
                ensure that compliant files can be understood by humans
                - therefore descriptions, dates, and author fields are
                either mandatory or highly recommended.

    <!-- Profiling mechanism -->

    <section id="profiling mechanism">
        <h2 id="the-profiling-profile">Profiling Mechanism</h2>
        <p>
            This section describes a generic mechanism to define a
            profile of the <a>TD specification</a> in a unambiguous way.
        </p>
        <p>
            The W3C WoT <a>Thing Description</a> specification defines a
            formal language, i.e. a set of vocabulary terms (keywords),
            a set of classes that are built from these keywords, and a
            set of additional rules, that define constraints on
            permitted values and keyword presence (mandatory / optional)
            dependent on the context where the keyword is used. In
            addition the TD specification defines relationships and
            corresponding cardinalities between these classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <a>TD specification</a> already has some constraints,
            but there is a wide variety of variations that are left to
            the interpretation or the discretion of an implementer. The
            rationale for the <a>Core Profile</a> is not to forbid
            complex things, rather to enable statements like:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><cite>If you constrain your TD to the <a>Core
                        Profile</a>, all other devices that conform the <a>Core
                        Profile</a> can interoperate with it out of the box.
            </cite></li>

            <p>
                A profile is a set of constraints and rules, which
                provide additional semantic guarantees that are applied
                to the TD specification. These constraints define a
                subset of valid <a>Thing Descriptions</a> by defining
                additional rules on various aspects of the <a>Thing
                    Description</a> specification.
            </p>

            <p>These constraints and rules fall into two categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>constraints for the data model.</li>
                <li>constraints for the protocol binding.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These two categories are orthogonal to each other,
                i.e. a data model that conforms to a profile can be
                mapped to different protocols. The protocol binding for
                each protocol may contain additional (protocol-specific)
                constraints.</p>

            <p>A profile is not exclusive, i.e. a thing may conform
                to multiple profiles. Profiles can build on top of each
                other or overlap, extended profiles can be built on top
                of the core profile.</p>

                        is NOT RECOMMENDED and the conscious decision is

                <p>
                    Data Schemas are used for the values of Properties,
                    Action input and output parameters and Event message
                    payloads. The value of a <em>Data Schema</em> can be
                    a simple type (boolean, integer, number, string) or
                    an instance of a structured type (array and object).
                </p>
                The <a>Core Data Model</a> applies the following
                constraints and rules to the
                <code>DataSchema</code>
                class of section 5.3.2.1 of the <a>TD Specification</a>.
                <p>
                    This section defines a subset of the class
                    <code>DataSchema</code>
                    that can be processed on resource-constrained
                    devices.
                <h4 id="constraints-against-the-td-specification">Data
                    Schema Constraints</h4>
                <p>
                    The <a>Core Data Model</a> restricts the use of
                    arrays and objects to the <strong>top level</strong>
                    of Data Schemas, i.e. only a one-level hierarchy is
                    permitted. The members of a top level
                    <code>object</code>
                    or
                    <code>array</code>
                    MUST NOT be array or object types.
                </p>
                <section class="note" title="RATIONALE">
                    <p>This may appear as a severe limitation,
                        however it is motivated by integrating with
                        multiple cloud services. Many enterprise
                        services and applications are based on
                        (relational) databases, where individual
                        property values are stored. Of course databases
                        can also store objects (e.g. encoded as a JSON
                        string), however this will prevent processing by
                        other enterprise applications.</p>
                    <p>
                        If a property conceptually has a deeper
                        structure, such as grid of lamps with RGB
                        colors, the structure can be represented in the
                        keyword of the property, i.e. lamp1_color_r,
                        lamp1_color_g and lamp1_color_b. A similar
                        mapping can be done for arrays and hierarchical
                        objects. This constraint leads to simpler <a>Thing
                            Descriptions</a> that can be handled by very
                        limited devices.

                    <h4>Recommended Practice</h4>
                    <p>
                        It is highly RECOMMENDED to always specify a
                        <code>unit</code>
                        , if a value has a metric. Authors of <em>Thing
                            Descriptions</em> should be aware, that units
                        that are common in their geographic region are
                        not globally applicable and may lead to
                        misinterpretation with drastic consequences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The field
                        <code>unit</code>
                        could be used for non-decimal numeric types as
                        well, e.g. a string value with binary or hex
                        data (
                        <code>0xCAFEBABE</code>
                        ,
                        <code>0b01000010</code>
                        ), where the unit is
                        <code>hex</code>
                        or
                        <code>bin</code>
                        , to indicate how the value should be
                        interpreted. It is strongly RECOMMENDED to use
                        the values
                        <code>hex</code>
                        ,
                        <code>oct</code>
                        or
                        <code>bin</code>
                        in this case to achieve interoperability.

                    The "type" relationship as defined in chapter 6 of

                    The <a>Core Data Model</a> defines a subset of the
                    security schemes that MAY be implemented on resource
                    constrained devices. A security scheme MUST be
                    defined at the thing level. The security scheme is
                    applied to the thing as a whole, a thing may adopt
                    multiple security schemes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The set of security schemes supported in the <a>Core
                        Data Model</a> is based on the plug-fest results. To
                    ensure interoperability, a TD consumer, which
                    compliant with the <a>Core Data Model</a> MUST
                    support <strong>all</strong> of the following
                    security schemes:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>no security</li>

            This section describes how the <a>Core Data Model</a> can be
            bound to different protocols. In addition to a set of
            mapping rules, it defines additional behavior, e.g.

                <h3>HTTP Protocol Binding</h3>
                <p>All communication is using JSON payloads over

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Note: Since HTTP does not provide a

                            is not supported directly. The event
                            mechanism can be used instead to send

                    <p>The HTTP verb POST is mapped to invoking an
