    <p>
      The <em>WoT Profile Specification</em> defines a Profiling Mechanism and a <em>WoT Core Profile</em>,
      which enables <em>out of the box interoperability</em>
      among things and devices. <em>Out of the box interoperability</em> implies,
      that devices can be integrated into various application scenarios without
      deep level adaptations. Typically only minor configuration operations are
      necessary (such as entering a network key, or IP address)
      to use the device in a certain scenario.
      These actions can be done by anyone without specific training.
    </p>
      The <a>WoT Core Profile</a> defines a set of <em>constraints
      and rules</em>, which compliant thing descriptions have to adopt
      to guarantee interoperability.
    </p>
    <p>
      These rules are prescriptive, to ensure that
      compliant implementations satisfy the semantic guarantees
      implied by them. We call this set of rules a <em>Profile</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>WoT Profile Specification</strong> as defined in
      this document serves two purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It defines a generic <strong>Profiling
          Mechanism</strong> which provides a mechanism to describe a
        profile in an unambiguous way. This mechanism can be
        used to define additional profiles.
      </li>
      <li>In addition, it defines a <strong><a>WoT Core
            Profile</a></strong> of the Thing Description, which
        consists of a core data model and protocol
        binding rules. The <a>WoT Core
          Profile</a> formalizes the results of several PlugFests
        that were conducted by the WoT Interest Group and of
        tests that were conducted as part of the development.
        <p>
          This document incudes a binding of the core data model to
          HTTP(S) and selected notification sub-protocols.
          The core data model can be bound to other protocols -
          it is expected that bindings to other protocols (e.g. MQTT, CoAP)
          will be defined in the near future.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="profile-abstract-1">
          A TD that is compliant to the <a>core profile</a> MUST adhere to
          both the constraints on the data model and the protocol binding.
          </span>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Devices that constrain their use of the Thing Description to
      the <a>WoT Core Profile</a> can interoperate with each other
      out-of-the-box.
    </p>
    <p>Note that the core profile is not exclusive. Device implementers are free to adopt
      other features of the thing description that go beyond the constraints
      of the core profile, however the interoperability guarantees of the core profile
      hold only for the <a>WoT Core Profile</a> subset.

    <section class="ednote">
      The name <em>WoT Core Profile</em> is still under discussion in the group and is used as a working title.
      It is subject to change after the profile specification has reached a certain level of maturity.

      <h3>Motivation for a Profile</h3>
    </section>

    <p>
      <span id="profile-abstract-2">
      The W3C WoT Thing Architecture [[wot-architecture11]] and
      WoT Thing Description [[wot-thing-description11]] define a
      powerful description mechanism and a format to describe
      myriads of very different devices, which may be connected
      over various protocols.
      </span>
      The format is very flexible and open
      and puts very few normative requirements on devices that
      implement it.</p>

    <p>
      However, this flexibility de-facto prevents
      interoperability, since, without additional <strong>rules</strong>,
      it allows implementers to make many choices that do not
      provide <strong>guarantees</strong> of common behavior
      between implementations.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section id='sotd'></section>

  <section id="intro">
    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The W3C WoT Architecture [[wot-architecture11]] and the WoT
      Thing Description [[wot-thing-description11]]
      have been developed as a versatile format, that allows
      describing the interactions between multiple devices and
      protocols.

    </p>
    <p>
      This flexibility permits an easy integration of new device
      types and protocols, however it risks interoperability,
      since there are <em>no guarantees</em> that two devices
      which are formally spec-compliant, will be able to
      communicate.
    </p>
    <p>To increase adoption of the WoT specifications,
      interoperability between on premise devices, edge devices
      and the cloud is essential. Even if every manufacturer is
      implementing the current Thing Description specification in
      full flexibility, there is no interoperability guarantee;
      many choices are still left to the implementations and there
      are very few normative requirements that a device has to
      fulfill.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Deployment Scenarios</h3>

      <p>A Thing Description can be used in two fundamentally
        different deployment scenarios:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a "brown-field" scenario, where it is created
          to describe the interactions with existing systems.</li>

        <li>a "green-field" scenario, where a device model
          and a thing description are developed together.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For green field deployments, where the implementations
        are being carried out and corresponding thing
        descriptions are being created, it is easier to achieve
        full interoperability by using a small, extensible <a>Core
          Profile</a>.
      </p>

      <p>In the brown field area, due to the nature of
        existing deployments and protocols, a broad spectrum of
        variations and potentially high complexity of thing
        descriptions inhibits interoperability and will most
        likely lead to additional profiles of the <a>WoT Thing Description</a>
        and domain-specific thing consumer implementations.</p>

      <p>
        The WoT <a>Core Profile</a> can be used by green field
        deployments and gives guidance to new implementers of
        the WoT specifications. It has already proved in
        brown-field scenarios in the PlugFests, where existing
        devices, that already existed as products, prototypes or
        demonstrators, were described with Thing Descriptions
        that are constrained to the <a>Core Profile</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Use Cases -->
  <section id="profile-use-cases">
    <h2>Use Cases and Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      A set of over 30 use cases for the Web of Things were contributed by stakeholders 
      from multiple industries for various application domains.
      These have been published in the WoT Use Cases and Requirements document [[wot-usecases]]. 
    </p><p>
      Based on these use cases a set of requirements have been derived which drive the development 
      of the W3C Web of Things specification family. 
      Several of these domains require easy integration of devices from multiple vendors, 
      in other words, out-of-the-box interoperability. 
      However, the descriptive approach taken by the WoT specifications generally leads 
      to a large variety of different protocols and data formats, 
      which can work against out-of-the box interoperability. 
    </p><p>
      For example, a WoT Thing Description (TD) can in theory include a description based on a 
      networking protocol unknown to a device that wishes to connect to it.  
      To ensure interoperability without additional customization (e.g. by writing software or 
      performing complex setup or configuration steps), 
      the range of such choices needs to be limited to a finite set so that a consumer 
      of a Thing Description can be sure it will be able to interact with any possible Thing. 
      A finite set of customization choices is also important for implementing devices with a fixed code base. 
      Defining such constraints leads to the profile mechanism and the WoT Core profile.
      </p>
      <p>
      In addition to multiple vertical use cases that will use HTTP(S) for their implementations,
      there are horizontal use cases that are addressed by this profile specification.
      The primary focus is to enable Multi-Vendor system integration with out of the box interoperability:
      </p>
      <section id="profile-use-case-MVSE">
        <h2>Multi-Vendor System Integration - Out of the box interoperability</h2>
          Users of devices want to process data from all devices that conform to a class of devices in a uniform way. 
          They need a guarantee that they are able to correctly interact with all affordances of the Thing 
          that complies with this class of devices. 
          Different interpretations of the same Thing Description, that lead to different behaviour, should not be possible.
          Users want to integrate devices in existing scenarios out of the box, i.e. with close to zero configuration tasks.
      </section>
    </section>
  
    <section id="why-profile">
      <h2 id="why-define-a-core-profile">
        Why a <a>Core Profile</a>?
      </h2>

      <p>
        During the recent WoT PlugFests there were many
        de-facto agreements on the use of a small constrained
        subset of interaction patterns and protocol choices.
        These de-facto agreements select a common subset of the
        <a>WoT Thing Description</a>, based on
        proven interoperability among manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of this specification is to formalize these
        agreements by defining a <strong><a>WoT Core
            Profile</a></strong> based on the choices that were made by
        the implementers of PlugFest devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="profile-1.2-why-a-core-profile-1">
        The <a>WoT Core Profile</a> contains additional
        normative requirements that MUST be satisfied by devices
        to be compliant to the profile.
        </span>
      </p>

        <figcaption>WoT Core Profile - A Subset of Affordances</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Adoption of the <a>WoT Core Profile</a> will
        significantly limit the implementation burden of device
        and cloud implementors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a>WoT Core Profile</a> was defined with the
        following main goals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>guarantee interoperability among all
          implementations of the profile.</li>
        <li>limit the implementation complexity.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It makes choices on the required metadata fields as
        well as the supported interactions and protocol
        endpoints. It introduces some constraints on data
        schemas for properties and actions which are required
        for resource constrained devices in real-world
        deployments. The format does not forbid the use of
        additional elements of the <a>WoT Thing Description</a> for vendor specific
        extensions, however this will impact interoperability.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability">Out-of-the-box
        interoperability</h2>
      <p>
        Devices, which implement the <a>Core Profile</a>, are <strong>out-of-the-box
          interoperable</strong> with other <a>Core Profile</a>
        compliant devices. Furthermore, the <a>Core Profile</a>
        simplifies device validation and compliance testing
        since a corresponding conformance test suite can be
        defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following classification adopts the terminology as described in the
        "H2020 â€“ CREATE-IoT Project - Recommendations for commonalities and
        interoperability profiles of IoT platforms" [[?H2020-CREATE-IoT]]
        report.
        The definitions below have been adapted to reflect the scope of the WoT profile.
      </p>
      <h3 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability-technical-interop">Technical Interoperability</h3>
      <p><em>Technical Interoperability</em> is usually associated with communication protocols and the
        infrastructure needed for those protocols to operate. This implies agreeing on a common protocol
        (e.g. HTTP / TCP/IP) and providing additional clarifications, where required.
      </p>

      <h3 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability-syntactic-interop">Syntactic Interoperability</h3>
      <p><em>Syntactic Interoperability</em> is usually associated with data formats and encodings along with
        techniques for compressing them. Examples for these formats and encodings in the WoT are JSON, 
        XML, JSON-LD, UTF-8 payloads.
      </p>
      <h3 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability-technical-interop">Semantic Interoperability</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Semantic Interoperability</em> is associated with a common understanding of the behavior of communication partners.
        In the profile context, it includes a common interpretation of (synchronous and asynchronous) action semantics, 
        a common event model, how to set/get multiple properties, writable properties, 
        a common error model and error messages.
      </p><p>
        Domain specific ontologies, e.g. semantic interop of automotive and medical devices exceed the scope of the profile.
      </p>
      <h3 id="out-of-the-box-interoperability-organisational-interop">Organisational Interoperability</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Organisational Interoperability</em> in the profile context implies that any consumer, 
        which conforms with a given profile can interact with any Thing which conforms 
        with the same profile, without additional customization.
      </p><p>
        Organisational Interoperability also requires commonly agreed approaches to security, 
        trust and privacy, i.e. a consumer is provided access to Things only, when these 
        common terms and conditions are applied.
      </p><p>
        Devices created by various engineers, vendors and SDOs that satisfy the requirements 
        of the profile spec can be integrated with compliant consumers without additional customization. 
        This works across infrastructures, regions and cultures.

      A TD Consumer satisfying the requirements of a profile should be able to process any TD also satisfying the profile
      and should be able to correctly interact with all affordances of the Thing such a TD describes.
    </p>
    
    This implies that a profile has three parts:
    <ul>
      <li>Restrictions on TDs</li>
      <li>Implementation requirements, constraints and behavioral assertions for Consumers</li>
      <li>Implementation requirements, constraints and behavioral assertions on Things</li>
    </ul>
    
      <section class="ednote">
        Note: We don't want to prevent a TD to have forms for additional protocols,
        but these can be ignored by compliant consumers, and could be removed without
        affecting profile comformance and compatibility.
        This may be useful for consumers that support multiple profiles.

    <h3>Limit and reduce complexity</h3>
    <!-- Supporters: Oracle, Siemens, Ben, Cristiano -->
    <p>
      Complexity addresses at least the follwing two things to simplify the development and
      reduce the implementation effort:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Implementation complexity on a thing and consumer, e.g. eliminating the need of RDF processing,
        but still permitting semantic annotations.</li>
      <li>Simplifying thing description to have fewer variations.</li>
      <li>Limiting the effort for JSON implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- 
    Note:
    Siemens: There should be multiple forms permitted, concerns on size limits on TDs, there may be edge devices with huge TDs. 
    We should not limit the length of a TD. Context extensions (e.g. for units) may need RDF processing, 
    semantic annotations are needed for that purpose. For simple semantic annotations, a JSON parser is sufficient. 
    It is not required for all uses cases of the profile to implement RDF processing. 
    It is hard to find these numbers for limitations, in some cases you have to do a specific agreement with a 
    customer to agree on their constaints / system limits, need to discuss with the customer, 
    identify frameworks, background, we cannot find a consensus. 
    Each IoT project is different, each customer uses a different framework.
    
    Ben: agree with all points of Sebastian, not all profiles should impose storage size and bandwidth limits.
    
    Cristiano: Disagree with limit storage and bandwidth requirements and Use finite (maximum) resources.
    
    Ege: agree on the requirement, we need to determine what we exactly mean with "complexity"
    
    Oracle: Complexity applies to all potential adopters, i.e. things, gateways, edge, cloud
    -->
    
    <h3>No Ambiguities, select single choice</h3>
    <!-- Supporters: Oracle, Fujitsu, Intel, Ben, Cristiano, Ege -->
    <p>
      Get rid of ambiguities, i.e. clarify specifications to define interpretation of a TD and behavior of the thing and
      consumer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples are the choice of properties vs. actions, use of PUT or POST for HTTP, observe protocols.
    </p>
    <!--
    Notes: 
    Intel: If something is really ambiguous, it needs to be updated in the TD, if there are multiple choices, 
    Profile can narrow down to one choice. 
    Ben: broadly support the requirement, however requiring that all profiles adopt the same ontology. 
    Choice of actions vs. properties should be done in the TD.
    This will probably create new requirements for the TD spec.
    -->
    
    <h3>Developer guidance</h3>
    <!-- Supporters: Fujitsu, Siemens, Intel, Oracle, Ben, Cristiano-->
    <p>
      A profile should help define what needs to be implemented. This requirement also includes behavioral goals and
      recommendations about best practice for the implementation of Consumers and Things.
    </p>
    <h3>Multiple profiles (mechanism)</h3>
    <!-- Supporters: Intel, Siemens, Ben, Cristiano, Hitachi -->
    <p>
      The mechanism used to indicate that a TD satisfies a profile should be general enough to indicate
      the TD satisfies the requirements for multiple profiles.
    </p>
    <!--
      Some people are concerned about fragmentation, if multiple profiles would be defined.
      However this requirement is about the mechanism to identify the profile in use.
  
    Discussion: 
    Does this mean a thing can support multiple profiles? 
    TD already supports multiple profiles Profiling mechanism is described in the profile spec, 
    may need to be polished
    -->
    
    <h3>Composable profiles</h3>
    <!-- Proposer: Intel, Hitachi, Siemens, Ben(*)-->
    <p>
      It should be possible to combine multiple profiles both for production and consumption:
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be possible to indicate that a consumer can ingest TDs that satisfy one or more profiles, even if each TDs
      individually only satisfies one profile. For example, a Smart Building may need to use both "constrained" devices and
      "unconstrained" devices. A gateway consuming TDs should be able to ingest TDs designed for both the constrained and unconstrained
      contexts.
    </p><p>
      A Thing that satisfies all the requirements for multiple TDs (for example, a device using protocols common to two
      different usage contexts) should be able to indicate that.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Validatible TDs</h3>
    <!-- Supporters: Intel, Oracle, Ben, Cristiano -->
    <p>
      Whether or not a TD satisfies the requirements of a given profile should be verifiable with automated tools.
      We can use the existing TD JSDON Schema as a basis and reuse the existing tooling (TD-playground)
    </p>
    <h3>Identification of profiles</h3>
    <!-- Supporters: Intel, Siemens, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Ben, Oracle -->
    <p>
      There should be a mechanism to identify which profiles a TD satisfies. This mechanism should be intrinsic to a TD,
      i.e. be in-band.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Profile should define a finite set of features and capabilities to implement by the consumer</h3>
    <!-- Supporters: Intel, Oracle, Fujitsu, Ben(*), IRI -->
    <p>
      A profile should limit the number of options, for example the set of possible protocols, to a finite set, so that a
      consumer can consume any TD in a given profile with a finite and static code base.
    </p>
    <!--
    Notes: Ben: A profile should not rule out other protocols. Things should be permitted to support other protocols, e.g.
    CoAP. Websockets are another example, these should be allowed in the same TD
    -->
    <!--
      
    <h3>Limit resource consumption</h3>
    Supporters: Oracle, Siemens (-), Fujitsu, Ben (-), Cristiano (-)
    
    Profiles should limit the maximum amount of resources necessary to generate and consume a TD.
    
    Notes: 
    
    Sebastian: We do not want limits in a profile for non-resource constrained devices. 
    I don't see the need for the current profile. 
    
    Ben: Agree that it is fine to have a profile for resource constrained devices, but should not be here. 
    
    Cristiano: Goal overlaps with limit and reduce complexity, this is use case specific, for a set of constrained devices 
    
    Oracle: All devices have resource limits. Reasonable limits increase interop, because they can be supported by a wide population of things. This will increase the likeliness of profile adoption/WoT adoption.
    
    <h3>Follow Security and Privacy Best Practices</h3>
    Proposers: Intel, Ben(*)
    
    Profiles should not specify security and protocol combinations that do not satisfy security best practices as described in the WoT Security Best Practices document.
    
    New security schemes may be added, others may be deprecated. McCool: Security best practices / guidelines are not published yet, no single scheme can be recommended, we cannot implement it across the use cases. Profile should follow best practices, we should discourage usage of insecure protocol. This could be a note to an informative document. Ben: subject to review of the actual best practices
    
    <h3>Developer Mode</h3>
    Proposers: Intel, Ben(-)
    
    There should be a mechanism to allow the "nosec" security scheme but only in a Developer context. Nosec may still be useful in a closed network even for production.
    
    Notes: this overlaps with previous section Cristiano: We can make this just a recommendation.

          <p>
            One of the primary benefits of the <a>WoT Thing
              Description</a> over a typical IoT format is the
            additional documentation for a human reader.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, the fields
            <code>title</code>
            and
            <code>description</code>
            are MANDATORY for Things, Property Affordances,
            Action Affordances, Event Affordances and Data
            Schemas.
          </p>
          <p>It is possible to have empty values for these
            fields, if, for specific purposes it is not
            desired to provide documentation, however this
            is NOT RECOMMENDED and the conscious decision is

        <p>
          Data Schemas are used for the values of Properties,
          Action input and output parameters and Event message
          payloads. The value of a <em>Data Schema</em> can be
          a simple type (boolean, integer, number, string) or
          an instance of a structured type (array and object).
        </p>
        The <a>Core Data Model</a> applies the following
        constraints and rules to the
        <code>DataSchema</code>
        class of section 5.3.2.1 of the <a>WoT Thing Description</a>
        Specification</a>.
        <p>
          This section defines a subset of the class
          <code>DataSchema</code>
          that can be processed on resource-constrained
          devices.

          Schema Constraints</h4>
        <p>
          The <a>Core Data Model</a> restricts the use of
          arrays and objects to the <strong>top level</strong>
          of Data Schemas, i.e. only a one-level hierarchy is
          permitted.

          The members of a top level
          <code>object</code>
          or
          <code>array</code>

            This may appear as a severe limitation,
            however it is motivated by integrating with
            multiple cloud services.
            </span>
            Many enterprise services and applications are based on
            (relational) databases, where individual
            property values are stored. Of course databases
            can also store objects (e.g. encoded as a JSON
            string), however this will prevent processing by
            other enterprise applications.</p>
          <p>
            If a property conceptually has a deeper
            structure, such as grid of lamps with RGB
            colors, the structure can be represented in the
            keyword of the property, i.e. lamp1_color_r,
            lamp1_color_g and lamp1_color_b. A similar
            mapping can be done for arrays and hierarchical
            objects. This constraint leads to simpler Thing
            Descriptions that can be handled by very
            limited devices.

            The <em>Thing Description</em> permits arbitrary

            resource constrained devices.

            It is highly RECOMMENDED to always specify a

            <span id="profile-5.1.4.3-thing-properties-recommended-practice-1">
            Authors of <em>Thing Descriptions</em> should be aware, that units
            that are common in their geographic region are

            misinterpretation with drastic consequences.
            </span>

          <p>
            The field

            ,
            <code>0b01000010</code>

          When an <code>Action</code> request is cancelled with a 
          <code>cancelaction</code> operation, its <code>ActionStatus</code>
          object is deleted and need not be retained. For all other
          <code>Action</code> requests it is assumed that a Web Thing will 
          store the <code>ActionStatus</code> object so that its status may
          later be queried with a <code>queryaction</code> or
          <code>queryallactions</code> operation. It is not expected that 
          <code>ActionStatus</code> objects should be retained indefinitely,
          they may be stored in volatile memory and/or periodically pruned.
          The length of time for which to retain <code>ActionStatus</code>
          objects is expected to be implementation-specific and may depend on
          application-specific requirements or resource constraints.

            sent, the Web Thing MUST set the <code>event</code> field to the

            MUST set the <code>event</code> field to the 
            name of the <code>EventAffordance</code> and populate the 
            <code>data</code> field with event data, if any. The 
            event data MUST follow the data schema specified in the
            <code>EventAffordance</code> and MUST be serialized in JSON.
            The <code>id</code> field SHOULD be set to a unique identifier for 
            the event, for use when re-establishing a dropped connection (see 
            below).
