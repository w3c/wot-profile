# Howe to provide profile test results

1. copy "inputs/results/template.csv" to a new file, name it after your implementation, e.g. acme.csv
2. provide your results in the columns 3 and 4, this works well with Excel and other applications that can handle csv files
3. Please add your results file to "inputs/results/"
3. Create a pull request with your results file.
